      transcription: `[00:00] Alex: Good morning, Sam. Thanks for taking the time to chat with me today about properties in your desired area. How are you doing?

[00:08] Sam: I'm doing well, thanks. I've been looking forward to finding the right property.

[00:15] Alex: Great! Before we look at specific properties, could you tell me about what you're looking for?

[00:28] Sam: Sure. I'm looking for something in the downtown area, preferably 1,500 to 2,000 square feet. My budget is between $500,000 and $750,000.

[00:42] Alex: I understand. The downtown area has some great properties in that range. What specific features are most important to you?

[00:56] Sam: I definitely need a modern kitchen and at least two bathrooms. Parking is a must, and I'd really like a good security system.

[01:05] Alex: Those are all reasonable requirements. What about location preferences within downtown?

[01:18] Sam: I'd like to be near public transport if possible, and I prefer a quieter neighborhood. Good natural light is important to me too.

[01:25] Alex: I see. And what about community amenities?

[01:38] Sam: Yes, those would be nice to have. Also, adequate storage space is important to me.

[01:45] Alex: Perfect. I have several properties that match these criteria. Let me tell you about them...
